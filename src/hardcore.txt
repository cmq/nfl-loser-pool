************* GO LIVE *************
- Run SQL queries
- /protected/config/settings.php
    change earliestYearHardcore to 2020 once testing is done for 2019


************* NEXT *************
- Archive->Past Winners (break down by hardcore match)
- Clean up snapshot
    - have they made a pick yet (if not, switch and pick in one motion)
    - etc
- New trophies
- New badges
- Figure out what to do with stats page and buildStats in maintenance controller
- Other maintance routines


************* IDEAS *************
- Add a button to switch modes on the "make picks" page
- Add a "snapshot" at the top of the homepage that shows the user's status:
    - which modes they are playing, and a quick switch between them
    - whether they've made a pick for the current week
    - their record in each mode they're playing
    - anything else?
- Switch coloring scheme to red when in hardcore mode
- Supernova badge for a perfect hardcore season
    - Update overview page once it's in place


************* TO DO *************
Archive->Past Winners (what does this look like?)

/root/protected/views/site/index.php
    Move the drawing of the snapshot to the controller or some other include
Format the snapshot
/protected/controllers/MaintenanceController.php
    actionRecalc (calls recalc badges, recalc bandwagon, etc)
/protected/models/User.php
    scopes need hardcore consideration; also need to search where each of these are used in the rest of the code
        active
        withThisYear
        withYears
/protected/views/stats/profiles.php
    uses userYears property to determine whether the user is paid.  Needs to consider hardcore mode
    whether or not a user is active (and whether the "show active users checkbox" affects them) needs to be aware of the current mode
/protected/views/layouts/main.php
    list of tons of other TODOs in this file
Modify the intro email
    Describe hardcore mode
    Tell them their account won't be active so their login will be broken
    Tell them that their display name is the same name they use to log in
Modify the login page to tell them their account won't be active until they've signed up
Modify all badge calculators
Modify all saved queries (in google drive and saved on navicat)
Bandwagon needs to be separated into hardcore/regular (search for "bandwagon")
    Archived seasons needs to take this into account
Clean up snapshot area
add ability to stick or un-stick talk messages as superadmin
reconsider power points
need a way to show a pick of teamid=0 on hardcore mode (failed to make a pick before lock).  Some icon or something
    note that it should only show if the current week is locked and the teamid is 0.  It's possible for a user to reset a future week back to teamid=0 and it not be wrong yet
how does margin of victory work in hardcore mode?  Should you automatically lose xxx points for not making a pick?
