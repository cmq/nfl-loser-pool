    <h2>The Bandwagon</h2>
    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <p>
        The Bandwagon is a feature that was introduced in 2014.  Similar to the Power Ranking, the Bandwagon isn't for
        money, it's simply for fun and/or bragging rights.  If you spend time reading the conversations that have taken
        place in archived seasons, you may notice that a common debate amongst players is who was taking the easy road or
        making the easy pick each week.  To put that to rest officially, The Bandwagon will track exactly that.
    </p>
    <h4>Determining the Bandwagon Pick</h4>
    <p>
        The concept of The Bandwagon is pretty simple:  Each week, there is one official "Bandwagon Pick."  Which team
        this is is determined by the team that is chosen by the largest number of players that week.  If two or more teams
        tie for having been picked the most in a given week, the official Bandwagon Pick becomes that team which was chosen
        by the player with the highest Power Ranking. 
    <p>
    <h4>Display on the Pick Board and Home Page</h4>
    <p>
        On the Pick Board each week, The Bandwagon is represented almost as one of the official Loser Pool players, always
        listed as the first row of picks.  You can see what the Bandwagon pick was for each week, as well as The Bandwagon's
        record, and when The Bandwagon got a pick wrong.  Each time a player is "On the Bandwagon" (meaning they have chosen
        the Bandwagon team for that week), a Bandwagon icon will show in place of their pick.  For weeks in the past, a very
        tiny Bandwagon icon will remain in the top corner of their pick as a reminder that they were on the Bandwagon that week.
        Finally, the Pick Board will also contain a column showing each player's current Bandwagon streak, with positive
        numbers representing weeks ON The Bandwagon, and negative numbers representing weeks OFF the Bandwagon.  For example,
        a streak of +3 means that player has been on The Bandwagon for 3 consecutive weeks, while a streak of -1 means the
        players has been OFF The Bandwagon for 1 week. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition to the Pick Board, there is also an entire section devoted to showing the players who are currently
        riding The Bandwagon.  By expanding that section on the Home Page, you can see who the Chief is, along with every other
        player currently on The Bandwagon.  In parenthesis after their name you will see the number of consecutive weeks each
        player has been riding.
    </p>
    <h4>Chief of the Bandwagon</h4>
    <p>
        Each week, the Bandwagon will have one Chief.  The Chief of the Bandwagon is the player who is on the longest current
        streak of having ridden the Bandwagon.  Ties go to the player with the highest Power Ranking.  The Chief will obtain
        the floating "Chief of the Bandwagon" badge, and will be displayed in the Bandwagon section on the home page for everyone
        to admire (or to mock). 
    </p>
    <h4>Stats and Other Fun Stuff</h4>
    <p>
        On each player's Profile page there is a section of stats related to the Bandwagon, including the frequency with which
        the player has been on The Bandwagon or even Chief of the Bandwagon over their career.  Additionally, there is also a
        count for the number of times the player has been a "Timely Bandwagon Jumper."  This accolade also comes with a badge.
        The way you become a Timely Bandwagon Jumper is by doing two things:
        <ul type="1">
            <li>Ride the Bandwagon for 3 or more consecutive weeks, getting your pick correct each of those times.</li>
            <li>STOP riding The Bandwagon on a week when The Bandwagon gets the pick wrong, but you get the pick right.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
