    <h2>Overview</h2>
    Welcome to the NFL Loser Pool.  This pool has been running since <?php echo param('earliestYear');?>.  Over the
    years there have been many bells and whistles added, but at the end of the day, the Loser Pool is about one thing
    only:<br />
    <br />
    <strong> - EACH WEEK, PICK ONE TEAM THAT LOSES THEIR GAME. - </strong><br />
    <br />
    It sounds easy, but in <?php echo $totalSeasons;?> seasons (encompassing <?php echo $totalPlayerSeasons;?> player-seasons), only <?php echo $perfectSeasons;?> times has a player completed a perfect season.<br />
