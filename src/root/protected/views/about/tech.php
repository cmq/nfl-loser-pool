    <h2>Technical Info</h2>
    <h4>Internet Explorer Sucks (and so do you if you use it)</h4>
    <p>
        The biggest technical note is that I strongly suggest you avoid using Internet Explorer not just for this site,
        but for web browsing in general.  It is horrible, and you are a bad person if you use it.  Additionally, it is
        the browser with which I test this site least frequently (read: "never"), and it also has the slowest Javascript
        implementation, meaning that your experience with rendering and sorting the various tables on the site will suffer.
    </p>
    <h4>Availability</h4>
    <p>
        Additionally, please keep in mind that while this system is now hosted at a real live hosting company, it is
        still subject to infrequent outages over which I have no control.  Please be understanding if any problems arise.
        Trust me, if the site is down, I'm far more frustrated by it than you are.  If the site is down at a time when
        you really need to make a pick, simply email the pick to me (<a href="mailto:kirk.hemmen@gmail.com">kirk.hemmen@gmail.com</a>)
        and I'll enter it for you when things are back online.
    </p>
    <h4>Reminder Emails</h4>
    <p>
        Finally, please note that even though I have an automated process that sends reminders to make your selection,
        people will occasionally miss these reminders for a number of reasons, but usually because they're flagged as
        spam or filtered out by the their mail provider.  Be smart and set your own reminders.  The reminders I send are
        a courtesy, but are not guaranteed to be delivered.  You are responsible for remembering to make your own pick!
